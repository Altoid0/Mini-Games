# Mini Games

[![Generic-Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-i--like--ya--code--g-blue)](https://shields.io/) [![official JetBrains project](http://jb.gg/badges/official.svg)](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/ALL/JetBrains+on+GitHub)

Welcome to Mini Games! There are 3 different games you can play: Dice Roll, Rock/Paper/Scissors, or Coin Flip. All of our projects have ASCII art to enhance your experience. 

## GitHub Guide - How to run our project on GitHub?

Pre-requisites: 
- GitHub Desktop - Downloaded
- IntelliJ - Downloaded

Downloading our code:
- Make a new folder on your host
- Open an admin powershell tab and navigate to the folder you created
- Type in the following command: 
git clone https://github.com/batman084/Mini-Games.git

Opening our code:
- Open IntelliJ
- File → Open
- Navigate to the folder you created with our code cloned
- Click open on that folder
- In the top toolbar, click on your configurations option: 
- Click the arrow and click edit configuration: 
- Clock on the three dots next to main class and select MainMenu: 
- Then click “Ok”
- Then click on the green arrow in the top toolbar: 
- Code will now run in Terminal :)


## Project Goals/Features:
* Randomly selects number out of an array to choose the number of each of the dice
* Rolling Animation while the dice are being rolled
* There are two dice that are rolled, and both are shown as the final output 
* ASCII art with the dice face
  
## AP Test Parallels:
  * Arrays
  * Objects
  * If/Else Statements
  * Classes
  * Primitive Data Types
  * 2D Arrays
  * Array Lists

## Unit -> Mini Game usage
Unit | Mini Game Usage | Example
---- | --------------- | -------
Primative Types 20% | Mini Games uses integer and boolean types | MainMenu.java uses boolean types in while loop and switch cases use integer types
Using Objects 15% | Mini Games is using multiple Objects and String (non-primitave data type) | We call objects of the different mini-game classes in MainMenu.java
Boolean Expression and Control statement 40% | Mini Games uses if and switch/case | We use control expressions like "if" and "switch/case" to control how the code runs. We also use boolean expressions to make sure that the code runs until the user says no. 
Writing Classes  15% | Mini Games defines RockPaperScissors, DiceRoll, CoinFlip, and MainMenu | We have different classes for each mini-game so that our code is modular and easier to edit
Arrays 10% | Mini Games uses arrays in multiple places | We use arrays in DiceRoll.java and in RockPaperScissors.java to get a random case.
