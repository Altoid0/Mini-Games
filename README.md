Welcome to Mini Games! There are 3 different games you can play: Dice Roll, Rock/Paper/Scissors, or Coin Flip. All of our projects have ASCII art to enhance your experience. 

## How to run our code?
Prerequisites: 
- [Java JRE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html)

Download the releases the open an admin terminal.
CD into the directory and run the following command: `java -jar <file name>`


## Project Goals/Features:
* Randomly selects number out of an array to choose the number of each of the dice
* Rolling Animation while the dice are being rolled
* There are two dice that are rolled, and both are shown as the final output 
* ASCII art with the dice face
  
## AP Test Parallels:
  * Arrays
  * Objects
  * If/Else Statements
  * Classes
  * Primitive Data Types
  * 2D Arrays
  * Array Lists

## Unit -> Mini Game usage
Unit | Mini Game Usage | Example
---- | --------------- | -------
Primative Types 20% | Mini Games uses integer and boolean types | MainMenu.java uses boolean types in while loop and switch cases use integer types
Using Objects 15% | Mini Games is using multiple Objects and String (non-primitive data type) | We call objects of the different mini-game classes in MainMenu.java
Boolean Expression and Control statement 40% | Mini Games uses if and switch/case | We use control expressions like "if" and "switch/case" to control how the code runs. We also use boolean expressions to make sure that the code runs until the user says no. 
Writing Classes  10% | Mini Games defines RockPaperScissors, DiceRoll, CoinFlip, and MainMenu | We have different classes for each mini-game so that our code is modular and easier to edit
Arrays 10% | Mini Games uses arrays in multiple places | We use arrays in DiceRoll.java and in RockPaperScissors.java to get a random case.  
2D Arrays 2.5% | Mini games uses 2D arrays the coin flip animation | We use arrays in CoinFlip.java for holding the strings that contain the ASCII art for the dice.  
Array Lists 2.5% | Mini games uses array lists to store the number of rolls you do | We use array lists in DiceRoll.java to store the number of dice rolls that you have so that they can all be printed out at the end.
